# Obstacle Avoidance bot
This project focuses on creating an intelligent robot capable of detecting obstacles and avoiding them in real-time using ROS2 development platform. 
With ChatGPT's help, i aim to streamline the development process and improve the effectiveness of ROS2 projects.
The repository includes all necessary resources, instructions for setup, and detailed documentation.
I encourage contributions from the open-source community to help improve this project and inspire innovative robotic solutions. 
Thank you for your interest in the "Obstacle Avoidance Bot" project, and i am look forward to collaborating with you!
