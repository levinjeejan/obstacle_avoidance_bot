# Obstacle Avoidance bot
This project intends to increase my coding abilities and familiarity with the ROS2 programming environment, and I am following Muhammad Luqman's tutorial to create an intelligent robot capable of recognising and avoiding obstacles in real-time. 

With the help of ChatGPT, may also reduce the development process and boost the efficacy of ROS2 projects.
The repository includes all necessary resources, setup instructions, and detailed documentation.
